# JON/Jopr Management
#
# To enable EWS for JON/Jopr management it is necessary to enable remote JMX access to the EWS server:
# 1) Choose an unused and accessible portNum
# 2) Follow the steps for secure access as described here: http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/management/agent.html.
# 3) Update and uncomment the following lines:
#
# JAVA_OPTS="${JAVA_OPTS} -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=<port>"
# JAVA_OPTS="${JAVA_OPTS} -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.access.file=<access-file-path>"
# JAVA_OPTS="${JAVA_OPTS} -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.password.file=<password-file-path>"
# JAVA_OPTS="${JAVA_OPTS} -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false"
# export JAVA_OPTS
